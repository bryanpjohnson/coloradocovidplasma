                <h2>I was sick with all the symptoms of COVID-19 coronavirus, but I was never tested. Can I donate plasma?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Unfortunately there are many Coloradans who have been sick but were unable to get a COVID-19 test for a variety of reasons. As of today, <span id="datetime"></span>, we are not aware of any Colorado donation centers that allow people to donate plasma without a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test at the time of their illness. So if you did not have a nasal swab test or a blood test for COVID-19, you may not donate your plasma as a treatment for others who are suffering with a current COVID-19 illness.</p>

                <h2>Okay, so I was sick with all the symptoms of COVID-19 coronavirus, and I was never tested. Will there be a time when I might be able to donate plasma?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>The science behind this is tricky. For instance, on March 8, 2020, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported that to date, there had been 29,199 total people tested and 5,655 people confirmed positive for COVID-19. This means that only about 20% of people tested have been positive for COVID-19. Blood donation centers need assurance that donor convalescent plasma will have COVID-19 antibodies.</p>
                    <p>In the future, it is possible that people without a COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis but have a highly-suspected COVID-19 illness, they may be able to donate convalescent plasma, especially if the demand for convalescent plasma exceeds the supply. Stay tuned to this website for announcements addressing this question.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>I was exposed to someone who was confirmed positive for COVID-19, and then I got the same sickness but was never tested. Can I donate plasma?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>No. As described in the question above, the donation collection centers need a laboratory confirmed test for COVID-19 at the time of illness for each donor.</p>

                <h2>What is plasma and why is it collected?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Plasma is the clear liquid portion of blood that remains after blood cells, platelets, and other cellular components are removed. It contains water, salts, antibodies, and other proteins. Plasma is collected to produce therapies to treat people with many types of disorders, including immunodeficiency, hemophilia, and trauma such as burns or shock.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Are there any risks to my health after donating plasma?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>People donate plasma every day. It is done at plasma and blood donation centers all around the country by trained medical teams in sterile environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>Donating plasma is a safe process. Most healthy adults can donate blood and plasma with no side effects. Some people may have minor side effects like dehydration, fatigue or dizziness. Donors are screened prior to donating to make sure they are good candidates.

            <div>
                <h2>Can I direct my plasma donation to a specific person in need, such as a friend or family member?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>That is a very heartwarming request! Unfortunately, this is not nearly as straightforward as it seems. Donor plasma must be screened by the standard procedures for blood products, such as blood type, which may not match the intended recipient. Furthermore, at this time there is a strong demand for convalescent plasma in Colorado's hospitals. The medical teams and blood banks have the difficult responsibility of deciding which patient gets the next available convalescent plasma product. Think of this like a wait list for receiving an organ transplant. Another way to think about this is, when you donate your plasma, it helps everyone and moves your loved one up the recipient list. When more donor plasma becomes available, directed donation to a specific recipient may be considered.

                    <p>"This is probably the least heroic way possible to be a hero. It doesn't take much to make a big, big impact."
