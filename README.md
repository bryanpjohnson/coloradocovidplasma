*The Colorado COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project Consortium was established on March 27, 2020, 
following an urgent outreach to experts at many of Colorado's premier institutions and Vitalant Blood Centers. 
Our consortium is the first regional collaboration of its kind in the United States, 
and the first consortium to collect and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to critically ill patients.*

I was contacted on April 7, 2020 with an urgent request to put up an information website for COVID-19 plasma donation. 
We put this site together in 2 days and launched on April 9, 2020.
