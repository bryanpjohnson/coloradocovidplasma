                <p style="color:red">NEWS ALERT:</p>
                <p>In Colorado, on November 5, 2020, the number of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 was 894, surpassing the peak of 888 patients in April, 2020.</p>
                <p>Scientific evidence suggests that the transfusion of convalescent plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 improves survival.</p>
                <p>Bottom line: COLORADO NEEDS PLASMA FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECOVERED FROM COVID-19, which means no fever and no shortness of breath at rest. We need plasma donation during 14 and 60 days of your recovery, since your antibody levels are the highest and most effective in fighting the illness in a hospitalized COVID-19 patient. We also know that the sooner the hospitalized patient receives plasma, the better chance of survival.</p>

                        People who convalesce (recover) from COVID-19 make antibodies against COVID-19 in their plasma component of blood. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use in COVID-19 is found in convalescent plasma. As more people contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential convalescent plasma donors will continue to increase. Giving this plasma to people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 disease may improve their chance of survival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On August 23, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This means that the FDA supports the use of convalescent plasma to improve survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. It also means that doctors can order convalescent plasma for their hospitalized patients, and this is reimbursed by health insurance companies.

                        <li>Donate between 14 days and 60 days of your recovery period. This is because your antibodies to fight COVID-19 are at the highest levels, giving the recipient the best chance of survival. Some blood centers allow you to donate beyond 60 days of your recovery.</li>

Our consortium is the first regional collaboration of its kind in the United States, and the first consortium to collect and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to critically ill patients.</p>

                    <p><b>Purpose:</b></p>
                    <p>To develop a timely, coordinated, Colorado multi-center network to collect, process, and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
                    <p>There are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the related pneumonia. People who convalesce (recover) from COVID-19 make antibodies against COVID-19 in their plasma component of blood. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use in COVID-19 is found in convalescent plasma. As more people contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential convalescent plasma donors will continue to increase. This may prove to be a breakthrough treatment for people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 disease.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Logistical Justification:</b></p>
                    <p>Given the public health emergency that the expanding COVID-19 outbreak presents, the US Food and Drug Administration is facilitating access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections through the process of emergency Investigational New Drug Applications for individual patients under 21 CFR 312.310.</p>
