                        There are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the related pneumonia. People who convalesce (recover) from COVID-19 make antibodies against COVID-19 in their plasma component of blood. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use in COVID-19 is found in convalescent plasma. As more people contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential convalescent plasma donors will continue to increase. Giving this plasma to people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 disease may be a major therapeutic breakthrough.

                    <p>If you are a physician caring for a patient with COVID-19 disease in the hospital, this is a general guide to help you obtain plasma for your patient.</p>
                    <p>There are three main pathways available to you for ordering and administering plasma as suggested by the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma#Collection%20of%20COVID-19" target="_blank">FDA Recommendations</a>. Please check with your hospital, as one of these three p​athways may be the suggested course of action:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Clinical Trials</b>
                        <p> Inquire whether your hospital is participating in a clinical trial, as your patient may be eligible to participate.
                        </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Expanded Access Protocol under a federally approved process</b>
                            <p>An Expanded Access Protocol (EAP), also called a "compassionate use" protocol, provides a pathway for patients to gain access to investigational therapy for serious diseases or conditions for which there are no comparable or satisfactory therapy options available outside of clinical trials. 
                            </p>
                            <p>FDA has worked with multiple federal partners and academia to open an EAP to facilitate access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma across the nation. Access to convalescent plasma is available through participation of acute care facilities under an Investigational New Drug (IND) that is already in place. The FDA asked Mayo Clinic to be the central Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the US EAP protocol. This request was intended to reduce the administrative burden on other institutions and the FDA by essentially allowing the use of the same product in the same manner.                           
                            </p>
                            <p>Please check with your hospital leadership on the feasibility of using this protocol. The Expanded Access Protocol is in place for your use: <a href="https://www.uscovidplasma.org/" target="_blank">National Expanded Access Treatment Protocol</a>. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Single Patient Emergency IND</b>
                            <p>This process was the original recommended pathway announced by the FDA. It was intended for a physician to order convalescent plasma as an emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) for the administration of convalescent plasma to one critically ill COVID-19 positive patient. In general, this process has been superseded by the FDA in favor of the Expanded Access Protocol described above, but can still be utilized if you expect to treat one or only a few patients. <a href=" https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma#Collection%20of%20COVID-19" target="_blank">Instructions can be found here</a>.

                    <p>The Colorado COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project Consortium was established on March 27, 2020, following an urgent outreach to experts at many of Colorado's premier institutions and Vitalant Blood Centers. Our consortium is the first regional collaboration of its kind in the United States, and the first consortium to collect and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to critically ill patients.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Purpose:</b></p>
                    <p>To develop a timely, coordinated, Colorado multi-center network to collect, process, and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
                    <p>There are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the related pneumonia. People who convalesce (recover) from COVID-19 make antibodies against COVID-19 in their plasma component of blood. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use in COVID-19 is found in convalescent plasma. As more people contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential convalescent plasma donors will continue to increase. This may prove to be a breakthrough treatment for people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 disease.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Logistical Justification:</b></p>
                    <p>Given the public health emergency that the expanding COVID-19 outbreak presents, the US Food and Drug Administration is facilitating access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections through the process of emergency Investigational New Drug Applications for individual patients under 21 CFR 312.310.</p>
