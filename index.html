                <p style="color:red">NEWS ALERT:</p>
                <p>In Colorado, on November 5, 2020, the number of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 surpassed the peak of 888 patients in April, 2020. The number of hospitalized patients is rising.</p>
                <p>Scientific evidence suggests that the transfusion of convalescent plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 improves survival.</p>
                <p>Bottom line: COLORADO NEEDS PLASMA FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECOVERED FROM COVID-19, which means no fever and no shortness of breath at rest. We need plasma donation during 14 and 60 days of your recovery, since your antibody levels are the highest and most effective in fighting the illness in a hospitalized COVID-19 patient. We also know that the sooner the hospitalized patient receives plasma, the better chance of survival.</p>

                        People who convalesce (recover) from COVID-19 make antibodies against COVID-19 in their plasma component of blood. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use in COVID-19 is found in convalescent plasma. As more people contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential convalescent plasma donors will continue to increase. Giving this plasma to people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 disease may improve their chance of survival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On August 23, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This means that the FDA supports the use of convalescent plasma to improve survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. It also means that doctors can order convalescent plasma for their hospitalized patients.

                    <p>If you are a physician caring for a patient with COVID-19 disease in the hospital, this is a general guide to help you obtain plasma for your patient.</p>
                    <p>There are two main pathways available to you for ordering and administering plasma as suggested by the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma#Collection%20of%20COVID-19" target="_blank">FDA Recommendations</a>. Please check with your hospital, as one of these two p​athways may be the suggested course of action:</p>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <p><b>Clinical Trials</b></p>
                    <p> Inquire whether your hospital is participating in a clinical trial, as your patient may be eligible to participate.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <hr>

                    <p><b>Emergence Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA</b></p>
                    <p>The FDA has approved convalescent plasma, an unapproved product, under Emergency Use Authorization as of August 25, 2020 for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.</p>
                    
                    <p>The process to order convalescent plasma may vary between hospitals, but this is the general workflow:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Before you proceed, review the ​FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/141478/download" target="_blank">Convalescent Plasma Provider Fact Sheet</a>.</li>
                        <li>Present the patient with the ​FDA’s Convalescent <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/141479/download" target="_blank">Plasma Recipient Fact Sheet</a>.</li>
                        <li>Obtain the patient’s assent for convalescent plasma and document the assent in the medical record.</li>
                        <li>Obtain the patient’s consent to blood products, indicating transfusion of convalescent plasma.</li>
                        <li>Order ABO typing so the blood bank has a validated ABO type on the patient.</li>
                        <li>Place the transfusion order in your hospital’s ordering system. Your hospital will likely have additional ordering processes in place specific to your blood bank supplier.</li>
                        <li>Plasma unit is transfused at bedside and administered according to local hospital procedures.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><b>Considerations</b></p>
                    <p><i>Dose:</i></p>
                    <p>The provider can choose 1 unit or 2 units of convalescent plasma. ​If choosing two units they must be ordered at the same time and the second administered within 12 hours of the start of the first.​ The issuing of two units will be dependent on the availability of supply of units of the appropriate blood type at the blood donor centers. The decision to use 1 or 2 units is at the discretion of the treating physician.  There is no data that confirms a benefit of two units over one unit​. ​Each unit is generally 200 mL. Factors that may be considered by the physician are the severity of illness, the patient’s body mass and the patient’s ability to tolerate the extra volume.</p>
                    <br>


                    <p><i>Prioritization given limited supply:</i></p>
                    <p>Convalescent plasma is a blood product of undetermined benefit based on limited clinical experience and may be in short supply at times depending on local epidemiology of disease. It is likely that the number of eligible patients for outstrips the number of available, matched units. We propose the following guidance for prioritizing its use.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First priority is patient safety: ​Over​ 73,000 in units have been transfused to over 103,000 patients to date in the US (<a href="https://www.uscovidplasma.org" target="_blank">https://www.uscovidplasma.org</a>).​ ​ ​Nonetheless, providers and patients/families should carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits prior to decision to treat.</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Known risks of blood products include:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>inadvertent infection with another infectious pathogen
                                    <li>general reactions such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) in patients with already severe lung damage.
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Additional concerns include:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>contribution to fluid overload</li>
                                    <li>potential worsening of immune-mediated tissue damage</li>
                                    <li>theoretical antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and blunting of development of endogenous immunity to the virus</li>

                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li><p>Several reports of retrospective matched cohort studies of COVID convalescent plasma (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/141480/download" target="_blank">​https://www.fda.gov/media/141480/download​</a>) ​have been made publicly available. 
                            ​<b> These studies generally found a trend towards improved mortality when patients were treated earlier in the course of disease.​</b> 
                            One study found an association between antibody titer and clinical response. These studies used varying approaches to matching, 
                            and based on the retrospective nature of their designs, may be subject to bias and confounding.​ Given the limited data available to guide decision-making, 
                            providers should consider prioritizing​:</p>

                    <p>The Colorado COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project Consortium was established on March 27, 2020, following an urgent outreach to experts at many of Colorado's premier institutions and Vitalant Blood Centers. Our consortium is the first regional collaboration of its kind in the United States, and the first consortium to collect and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to critically ill patients.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p><b>Participating Institutions:</b></p>
                    
                    <ul class="institutions">
                        <li>Centura Health</li>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>Purpose:</b></p>
                    <p>To develop a timely, coordinated, Colorado multi-center network to collect, process, and deliver COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
                    <p>There are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the related pneumonia. People who convalesce (recover) from COVID-19 make antibodies against COVID-19 in their plasma component of blood. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use in COVID-19 is found in convalescent plasma. As more people contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential convalescent plasma donors will continue to increase. This may prove to be a breakthrough treatment for people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 disease.</p>
